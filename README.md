The At Least You're Trying Podcast app for Android

Single-purpose podcast app for [At Least You're Trying](http://gtradio.net/alyt).

Hopefully, this app provides an easy way to listen to the At Least You're Trying podcast for users who are not yet familiar with the overall podcast ecosystem.

[AntennaPodSP](https://github.com/danieloeh/AntennaPodSP) provides the foundation for the At Least You're Trying podcast app.
The alyt-app repository was not forked directly from AntennaPodSP so that Github issues could be created specifically for this project.
